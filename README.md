- Lead Status
- Agent Call Duration
- Customer Call Duration
- From Calling Number
- To Calling Number
- Attempt Number
- Created At
- Updated At
- Agent Name
- Agent ID
- Call Connected Status
- Call Dial Time

#### Reports Generated:

1. **Campaign and Call Status Report**:
   - **Total Calls**: Count of all calls made.
   - **Unique Leads**: Number of distinct leads contacted.
   - **Calls Connected**: Number of calls successfully answered.
   - **Unique Calls Connected**: Distinct leads that answered at least one call.
   - **Leads Converted**: Leads that expressed interest (status: Interested).
   - **Leads Lost**: Leads that were not interested (status: Not Interested).
